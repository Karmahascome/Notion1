# Notion1
Hello! I actually am not a programmer or know anything about this. I am just a mom following youtube tutorials who wants a better clock in notion because they all seem to have too much padding and I am broke.
If you are kind enough to have advice and help me figure out what the heck I'm doing wrong I would appreciate it. 
Thank you.
Jozlyn :)
